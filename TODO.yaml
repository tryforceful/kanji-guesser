  - add sounds to read Japanese
    - autoplay option?
  - put X on the "About This App" so we can just show it once for new users
  - warn that going to settings/menu etc mid-quiz will kill the quiz
  - Color Blind:
      - In outline mode, the success and failure button responses look too similar
