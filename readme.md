## About This App

This app is a Japanese language learning tool designed to improve your kanji recognition skills and help you discern between similar-looking kanji. **Kanji** (漢字) are Japanese symbols that were borrowed from the Chinese writing system.)

Japanese vocabulary words will be shown to you on a series of flashcards with a kanji character missing from each word. You must choose the correct kanji from the available choices. A reading gloss is provided to you as a hint either in **kana** (Japanese characters, かな) or **romaji** (English letters).
