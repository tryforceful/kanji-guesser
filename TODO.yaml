TODO:
  - Add keyboard support for desktop users
  - add sounds to read Japanese
    - autoplay option?
  - put X on the "About This App" so we can just show it once for new users
  - warn that going to settings/menu etc mid-quiz will kill the quiz
  - Color Blind:
      - In outline mode, the success and failure button responses look too similar

Ideas:
  - Different categories for the quiz like
    - everyday
    - business
    - relationships
    - travel
    - legal
  - Tips to regonize what the kanji could be. Share them when people get them wrong.
  - Retake the same exam set they just took (or did earlier) so they can compare progress over time for a particular kanji/set
