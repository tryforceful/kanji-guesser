TODO:
  - Add keyboard support for desktop users
  - add sounds to read Japanese
    - autoplay option?
  - add choice to see in Romaji versus Kana
  - fix layout of buttons with CSS Grid
  - offer choices of Hard (12) Easy (4) Medium (8) difficulty
  - put X on the "About This App" so we can just show it once for new users
  - warn that going to settings/menu etc mid-quiz will kill the quiz
  - Color Blind:
      - In outline mode, the success and failure button responses look too similar

Data Checks (jest?):
  - KanjiSlug is not in list of Distractors
  - Distractors are all unique
  - List of Distractors is at least 11 long
  - Kanji Slug is just one letter long (?)
  - Distractors are each just one letter long (?)
  - There are proper romaji, furigana glosses for everything
